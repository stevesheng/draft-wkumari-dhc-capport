    <abstract>
      <t>In many environments (such as hotels, coffee shops and other
      establishments that offer Internet service to customers) it is common to
      start new connections in a captive portal mode, i.e. highly restrict
      what the customer can do until the customer has accepted terms of
      service, provided payment information or authenticated.</t>

      <t>This document describes a DHCP option to inform clients that they are
      behind some sort of captive portal device, and that they will need to
      authenticate to get Internet Access.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In many environments (coffee shops and hotels being the standard
      examples) users need to connect to a captive portal device to agree to
      an acceptable use policy or provide billing information before they can
      access the Internet.</t>

      <t>In order to present the user with the captive portal web page, many
      devices perform DNS and / or HTTP and / or IP hijacks. As well as being
      kludgy hacks, these techniques looks very similar to attacks that things
      like DNSSEC and TLS protect against.</t>

      <t>This document describes a DHCP option (Captive-Portal) that informs
      DHCP clients that they are behind a captive portal device, and how to
      contact it.</t>

      <t>This document neither condones nor condemns captive portals; instead
      it recognises that they are here to stay, and attempts to improve the
      user's experience.</t>

      <section title="Requirements notation">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119"></xref>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Background">
      <t>Many places provide public Internet access, but require that the user
      first accepts some sort of Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and / or provides
      billing information (such as their last name and / or room number in a
      hotel, credit card information, etc) though a web interface.</t>

      <t>In order to meet this requirement many places implement a captive
      portal (CP) - a system that intercepts user requests and forces them to
      an interstitial login page.</t>

      <t>Captive portals implement this interception in a number of ways,
      including:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>DNS Redirection</t>

          <t>IP Redirection</t>

          <t>HTTP Redirection</t>

          <t>Restricted scope addresses</t>

          <t>Traffic blocking (until the user is authenticated)</t>
        </list>In order to ensure that the user is unable to access the
      Internet, captive portals usually implement IP based filters, or place
      the user in to a restricted VLAN or restricted IP range until after they
      have been authorized.</t>

      <section title="DNS Redirection">
        <t>The captive portal either intercepts all DNS traffic or is
        advertised (for example using DHCP) as the recursive server for the
        network. Until the user has authenticated to the captive portal, the
        CP responds to all DNS requests listing the address of its web portal.
        Once the user has authenticated the CP returns the "correct"
        addresses.</t>

        <t>This technique has many shortcomings, including the fact that it
        fails if the client is performing DNSSEC validation, if the client
        already has the DNS information cached, etc.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="HTTP Redirection">
        <t>The captive portal acts like a transparent HTTP proxy, but when it
        sees an HTTP request from an unauthenticated client it intercepts the
        request and responds with an HTTP status code 302 to redirect the
        client to the Captive Portal Login.</t>

        <t>Among the issues with this technique are:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>Fails if the user is only using HTTPS</t>

            <t>Exposes various private user information, such as HTTP Cookies,
            etc.</t>

            <t>Doesn't work if the client has a VPN and / or proxies their web
            traffic to an external web proxy.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="IP Hijacking">
        <t>The captive portal intercepts connections to any IP address. It
        spoofs the destination IP address and "pretends" to be whatever the
        user tried to access.</t>

        <t>This has most of the same issues as the HTTP solution, but may also
        break other protocols, may expose more of the users private
        information, etc.</t>

        <t></t>

    <section title="The Captive-Portal DHCP Option">
      <t>The Captive Portal DHCP Option (TBA1) informs the DHCP client that it
      is behind a captive portal and provides the URI to access the
      authentication page.</t>

      <t>The format of the DHCPv4 Captive-Portal DHCP option is shown
      below.<figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[  Code    Len          Data
  +------+------+------+------+------+--   --+-----+
  | code |  len |  URI                  ...        |
  +------+------+------+------+------+--   --+-----+
]]></artwork>
        </figure></t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Code: The Captive-Portal DHCP Option (TBA1)</t>

          <t>Len: The length, in octets of the URI.</t>

          <t>URI: The URI of the authentication page that the user should
          connect to.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The URI SHOULD be a URL with an IP-literal for the host portion (to
      remove the need to allow DNS from unauthenticated clients).</t>

      <t>[ED NOTE: Using an address literal is less than awesome, but better
      than the alternatives. Recommending a DNS name means that the CP would
      need to allow DNS from unauthenticated clients (as we don't want to
      force users to use the CP's provided DNS) and some folk would use this
      to DNS Tunnel out. This would make the CP admin block external
      recursives).]</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Use of the Captive-Portal Option">
      <t>[ED NOTE: This section is, and probably will remain, fairly hand
      wavy. This option provides notice to the OS / User applications that
      there is a CP, but I think that the UI / etc is best designed / handled
      by the Operating System vendors / Application developers. ]</t>

      <t>The purpose of the Captive-Portal DHCP Option is to inform the
      operating system and applications that they are behind a captive portal
      type device, and will need to authenticate before getting network access
      (and how to reach the authentication page).</t>

      <t>The exact method that the interaction with the user occurs is device
      / operating system / application dependent, the below is simply one
      option.</t>

      <t>When the device receives a DHCP response with the Captive-Portal
      Option it SHOULD:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Not initiate new IP connections until the CP has been satisfied.
          [TODO(Someone): Existing connections should be placed on hold (need
          better text). This will happen more often than some expect -- you
          buy 1h of Internet at a cafe and stay there for 3h -- this will
          "interrupt" you a few times).]</t>

          <t>Present a dialog box to the user informing that they are behind a
          captive portal and ask if they wish to proceed.</t>

          <t>If the user elects to proceed, the device should initiate a
          connection to the captive portal login page using a web browser
          configured with a separate cookie store. Some captive portals send
          the user a cookie when they authenticate (so that the user can
          re-authenticate more easily in the future - the browser should keep
          these CP cookies separate from other cookies.</t>

          <t>Once the user has authenticated (how does it know? HTTP
          response?! Probe (ugh?)) normal IP connectivity should resume.</t>

          <t>The device should (using an OS dependent method) expose to the
          user / user applications that they have connected though a captive
          portal (for example by creating a file in /proc/net/ containing the
          interface and captive portal URI). This should continue until the
          network changes, or a new DHCP message without the CP is
          received.</t>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>[ This section stolen from draft-ietf-dhc-access-network-identifier.
      :-) ]</t>

      <t>This document defines DHCPv4 Captive-Portal option which requires
      assignment of DHCPv4 option code TBD1 assigned from "Bootp and DHCP
      options" registry (http://www.iana.org/assignments/
      bootp-dhcp-parameters/bootp-dhcp-parameters.xml), as specified in
      [RFC2939].</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>An attacker with the ability to inject DHCP messages could include
      this option and so force users to contact him. As an attacker with this
      capability could simply list himself as the default gateway (and so see
      all the victims traffic) we do not think this gives them significantly
      more capabilities. Fake DHCP servers are currently a security concern -
      this doesn't make them any better or worse.</t>

      <t>Devices and systems that automatically connect to open network could
      potentially be tracked using the techniques described in this document
      (forcing the user to continually authenticate, or exposing their browser
      fingerprint), but similar tracking could already be performed with the
      standard captive portal mechanisms, so this doesn't seem to give the
      attackers more capabilities.</t>

      <t>By simplifying the interaction with the captive portal systems, and
      doing away with the need for interception, we think that users will be
      less likely to disable useful security safeguards like DNSSEC
      validation, VPNs, etc.</t>
