    <abstract>
      <t>In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet access
      (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a
      captive portal mode. This highly restricts what the customer can do
      until the customer has authenticated.</t>

      <t>This document describes a DHCP option (and a RA extension) to inform
      clients that they are behind some sort of captive portal device, and
      that they will need to authenticate to get Internet Access. It is not a
      full solution to address all of the issues that clients may have with
      captive portals, but it is designed to be used in larger solutions. </t>

      <t>[ Ed note (remove): This document basically informs a client that it
      is behind a captive portal, and where to contact the captive portal. It
      does not remove the need for clients to probe for CPs, it merely speeds
      up and simplifies discovery. It is not a captive portal interaction
      protocol - that will be developed in another document - see the CP
      mailing list: https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/captive-portals. It
      is expected that this protocol will include things like a way to
      determine how much time is remaining, how to re-authnticate, when the CP
      has been satisfied, etc. ]</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In many environments, users need to connect to a captive portal
      device and agree to an acceptable use policy (AUP) and / or provide
      billing information before they can access the Internet. It is
      anticipated that the IETF will work on a more fully featured protocol at
      some point, to ease interaction with Captive Portals. Regardless of how
      that protocol operates, it is expected that this document will provide
      needed functionality (the client will need to know when it is behind a
      CP and how to contact it). </t>

      <t>In order to present users with the payment or AUP pages the captive
      portal device has to intercept the user's connections and redirect the
      user to the captive portal, using methods that are very similar to
      man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. As increasing focus is placed on
      security, and end nodes adopt a more secure stance, these interception
      techniques will become less effective and / or more intrusive.</t>

      <t>This document describe a DHCP (<xref target="RFC2131"/>) option
      (Captive Portal) and an IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) (<xref
      target="RFC4861"/>) extension that informs clients that they are behind
      a captive portal device and how to contact it.</t>

      <t>This document neither condones nor condemns the use of captive
      portals; instead, it recognises that their apparent necessity, and
      attempts to improve the user experience and increase the success of
      captive portals.</t>

      <t>[ Ed note: This solution is somewhat similar / complements 802.11u /
      WiFi Passpoint Online Sign-up, but is much simpler, easier to deploy,
      and works on wired as well ]</t>

      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Background">
      <t>Some ISPs implement a captive portal (CP) - a system that intercepts
      user requests and redirects them to an interstitial login page - in
      order to require the user accept an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), provide
      billing information, or otherwise authenticate a user prior to allowing
      them to access the Internet.</t>

      <t>Captive portals intercept and redirect user requests in a number of
      ways, including:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>DNS Redirection</t>

          <t>IP Redirection</t>

          <t>HTTP Redirection</t>

          <t>Restricted scope addresses</t>

          <t>Traffic blocking (until the user is authenticated)</t>
        </list>In order to ensure that the user is unable to access the
      Internet until they have satisfied the requirements, captive portals
      usually implement IP based filters, or place the user into a restricted
      VLAN (or restricted IP range) until after they have been authorized /
      satisfied.</t>

      <t>These techniques are very similar to attacks that protocols (such as
      VPNs, DNSSEC, TLS) are designed to protect against. The interaction of
      these protections and the interception leads to poor user experiences,
      such as long timeouts, inability to reach the captive portal web page,
      and similar issues.</t>

      <t>The interception may also cause other issues for the user - for
      example, in some cases many tabs in a browser will be redirected, and
      getting back to the original pages may be difficult, some applications
      may perform DNS requests when the computer connects to a network and
      will cache the redirect DNS response and requre a restart, etc. The
      captive portal itself can also become a security concern - for example,
      instances have been observed where the captive portal will log the URLs
      that it has intercepted, including URLs that include credenitals.</t>

      <t>The user is often unaware of what is causing the issue (their browser
      appears to hang, saying something like "Downloading Proxy Script", or
      simply "The Internet doesn't work"), and they become frustrated. This
      may result in them not purchasing the Internet access provided by the
      captive portal. The connectivity attempts may also facilitate OS
      fingerprinting even before a client attempts to connect to the portal
      itself.</t>

      <t>By informing the end user's computer that it is behind a captive
      portal (and how to contact the captive portal) this document improves
      the users's experiance (by speeding up their interaction), improves
      security (by not leaking cookies and credentials) and improves the
      success of the captive portal.</t>

      <section title="DNS Redirection">
        <t>The CP either intercepts all DNS traffic or advertises itself (for
        example using DHCP) as the recursive server for the network. Until the
        user has authenticated to the captive portal, the CP responds to all
        DNS requests listing the address of its web portal. Once the user has
        authenticated, the CP returns the "correct" addresses.</t>

        <t>This technique has many shortcomings. It fails if the client is
        performing DNSSEC validation, is running their own resolver, is using
        a VPN, or already has the DNS information cached. Many applications
        also ignore the DNS TTL, and so may incorrectly cache the captive
        portal's IP address, requring a restart of the application.,</t>
      </section>

      <section title="HTTP Redirection">
        <t>In this implementation, the CP acts like a transparent HTTP proxy;
        but when it sees an HTTP request from an unauthenticated client using
        HTTP/1.0, it intercepts the request and responds with an HTTP status
        code 302 to redirect the client to the Captive Portal Login. If the
        client is using HTTP/1.1, it respond with a status code 303
        instead.</t>

        <t>This technique has a number of issues, including:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>It fails if the user is only using HTTPS sites.</t>

            <t>If the address the user browsed to uses HSTS <xref
            target="RFC6797">(see </xref>).</t>

            <t>It exposes various private user information, such as HTTP
            Cookies, etc.</t>

            <t>It doesn't work if the client has a VPN and / or proxies their
            web traffic to an external SSL/TLS proxy.</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>

      <section title="IP Hijacking">
        <t>In this scenario, the captive portal intercepts connections to any
        IP address. It spoofs the destination IP address and "pretends" to be
        whatever the user tried to access.</t>

        <t>This technique has issues similar to the HTTP solution, but may
        also break other protocols, and may expose more of the user's private
        information.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="The Captive-Portal Option">
      <t>The Captive Portal DHCP / RA Option informs the client that it is
      behind a captive portal and provides the URI to access an authentication
      page. This is primarily intended to improve the user experience by
      getting them to the captive portal faster; for the foreseeable future
      (until such time that most systems implement this technique) captive
      portals will still need to implement the interception techniques to
      serve legacy clients, and clients will need to perform probing to detect
      captive portals.</t>

      <t>In order to support multiple "classes" of clients (e.g: IPv4 only,
      IPv6 only with DHCPv6(<xref target="RFC3315"/>), IPv6 only with RA) the
      captive portal can provide the URI via multiple methods (IPv4 DHCP, IPv6
      DHCP, IPv6 RA). The captive portal operator should ensure that the URIs
      handed out are equivalent to reduce the chance of operational
      problems.</t>

      <t>In order to avoid having to perform DNS interception, the URI SHOULD
      contain an address literal, but MAY contain a DNS name if the captive
      portal allows the client to perform DNS requests to resolve the
      name.</t>

      <t>[ED NOTE: Using an address literal is less than ideal, but better
      than the alternatives. Recommending a DNS name means that the CP would
      need to allow DNS from unauthenticated clients (as we don't want to
      force users to use the CP's provided DNS) and some users would use this
      to DNS Tunnel out, which may make the CP admin block external
      recursives). DNS is needed to allow operators to serve SSL/TLS for e.g
      billing (certificates with IP addresses are frowned upon :-))]</t>

    <section title="Use of the Captive-Portal Option">
      <t>[ED NOTE: This option provides notice to the OS / User applications
      that there is a CP. Because of differences in UI design between
      Operating Systems, the exact behaviour by OS and Applications is left to
      the OS vendor/Application Developer.]</t>

      <t>The purpose of the Captive-Portal Option is to inform the operating
      system and applications that they are behind a captive portal type
      device and will need to authenticate before getting network access (and
      how to reach the authentication page). What is done with this
      information is left up to the operating system and application vendors.
      This document provides a very high level example of what could be done
      with this information.</t>

      <t>Many operating systems / applications already include a "connectivity
      test" to determine if they are behind a captive portal (for example,
      attempting to fetch a specific URL and looking for a specific string
      (such as "Success"). These tests sometimes fail or take a long time to
      determine when they are behind a CP, but are usually effective for
      determining that the captive portal has been satisfied. These tests will
      continue to be needed, because there is currently no definitive signal
      from the captive portal that it has been satisfied. [ Editor note: It
      may be useful to write another document that specifies how a client can
      determine that it has passed the CP. This document could also contain
      advice to implementors on only intercepting actually needed ports, how
      to advertise that the CP needs to be satisfied *again*, etc. This should
      not be done in this document though. ] The connectivity test may also
      need to be used if the captive portal times out the user session and
      needs the user to re-authenticate. The operating system may still find
      the information about the captive portal URI useful in this case.</t>

      <t>When the device is informed that it is behind a captive portal on a
      particular network interface, it should:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>Not initiate new IP connections through that interface until the
          CP has been satisfied (other than those to the captive portal
          browser session and connectivity checks). Existing connections
          should be quiesced (this will happen more often than some expect --
          for example, the user purchases 1 hour of Internet at a cafe and
          stays there for 3 hours -- this will "interrupt" the user a few
          times).</t>

          <t>Present a dialog box to the user informing them that they are
          behind a captive portal and ask if they wish to proceed.</t>

          <t>If the user elects to proceed, the device should initiate a
          connection to the captive portal login page using a web browser
          configured with a separate profile, incliding a separate cookie
          store, and without a proxy server. If there is a VPN in place, this
          connection should be made outside of the VPN context and the user
          should be informed that connection is outside the VPN. Some captive
          portals send the user a cookie when they authenticate (so that the
          user can re-authenticate more easily in the future) - the browser
          should keep these CP cookies separate from other cookies.</t>

          <t>Once the user has authenticated, normal IP connectivity should
          resume. The OS can then use this string to provide further
          information to the user.</t>

          <t>The device should (using an OS dependent method) expose to the
          user / user applications that they have connected though a captive
          portal (for example by creating a file in /proc/net/ containing the
          interface and captive portal URI). This should continue until the
          network changes, or a new DHCP message without the CP is
          received.</t>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document defines two DHCP Captive-Portal options, one for IPv6
      and one for IPv6. It requires assignment of an option code (TBA1) to be
      assigned from "Bootp and DHCP options" registry
      (http://www.iana.org/assignments/
      bootp-dhcp-parameters/bootp-dhcp-parameters.xml), as specified in
      [RFC2939]. It also requires assignment of an option code (TBA2) from the
      "DHCPv6 and DHCPv6 options" registry
      (http://www.iana.org/assignments/dhcpv6-parameters/dhcpv6-parameters.xml).</t>

      <t>IANA is also requested to assign an IPv6 RA Option Type code (TBA3)
      from the "IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option Formats" registry. Thanks
      IANA!</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>An attacker with the ability to inject DHCP messages could include
      this option and so force users to contact an address of his choosing. As
      an attacker with this capability could simply list himself as the
      default gateway (and so intercept all the victim's traffic), this does
      not provide them with significantly more capabilities. Fake DHCP servers
      / fake RAs are currently a security concern - this doesn't make them any
      better or worse.</t>

      <t>Devices and systems that automatically connect to an open network
      could potentially be tracked using the techniques described in this
      document (forcing the user to continually authenticate, or exposing
      their browser fingerprint.) However, similar tracking can already be
      performed with the standard captive portal mechanisms, so this technique
      does not give the attackers more capabilities.</t>

      <t>By simplifying the interaction with the captive portal systems, and
      doing away with the need for interception, we think that users will be
      less likely to disable useful security safeguards like DNSSEC
      validation, VPNs, etc. In addition, because the system knows that it is
      behind a captive portal, it can know not to send cookies, credentials,
      etc. Redirection to a portal where TLS can be used without hijacking can
      ameliorate some of the implications of connecting to a potentially
      malicious captive portal.</t>

      <t>From -12 to -13.1:</t>

      <t>There was a Caprive Portal Bar BoF held at the Dallas IETF meeting.
      See https://github.com/httpwg/wiki/wiki/Captive-Portals for some
      details. This document was discussed, and I got a fair bit of feedback.
      Incorporating some of this in -13.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>"In the text discussing why a captive portal notification might
          be useful (section 2.2 maybe?), perhaps you should say something
          about HSTS and HTTP2.0, since they will further erode the ability to
          use common captive portal redirection techniques." - Wes George.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Ted Lemon and Joel Jaeggli: there's no benefit to insisting on an
          ordering. I think you should just say that the ordering is
          indeterminate, and if different mechanisms give non-equivalent
          answers, this is likely to cause operational problems in
          practice.</t>

      <t>From 08 to 09:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">

          everything.</t>

          <t>CP's *can* do HTTP redirects to DNS banes, as long as they allow
